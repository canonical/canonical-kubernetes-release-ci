USAGE = "Promote revisions for Canonical Kubernetes tracks"

DESCRIPTION = """
Promote revisions of the Canonical Kubernetes snap through the risk levels of each track.
Expects snapcraft to be logged in with sufficient permissions, if not dry-running.
The script only targets releases. The 'latest' track is ignored.
Each revision is promoted after being at a risk level for a certain amount of days.
The script will only promote a revision to stable if there is already another revision for this track at stable.
The first stable release for each track requires blessing from SolQA and is promoted manually.
