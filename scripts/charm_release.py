"""
Script to automate the k8s-operator charms release process.

The implementation works as a state machine that queries the current state of each track
and then decides what to do next.The script is designed to be idempotent, meaning that it
can be run multiple times without causing any harm. Note than the script is only checking
the state of the last revision published on each track. That means if revisions n and n+1
are published on a track, the automation only tries to reconcile the n+1 revision. Whatever
state the revision n is in will be untouched.

for each (track, arch):
    get data for current (track, arch) state:
        - extract latest revision on channel=<track>/candidate from (track, arch)
        - extract latest revision on stable_channel=<track>/stable from (track, arch)
        - skip if the latest revision on <track>/candidate is already published in <track>/stable
        - get the (track, arch) state with corresponding (channel, revision) from SQA API

    track with corresponding (channel, revision) is in one of the following states:
        - no TPIs yet -> NO_TEST
        - at least one TPI succeeded -> TEST_SUCCESS
        - at least one TPI in progress -> TEST_IN_PROGRESS
        - there are only failed/(in-)error TPIs -> TEST_FAILED

    Actions:
        - NO_TEST: start a new TPI
        - TEST_IN_PROGRESS: just print that a log message
        - TEST_SUCCESS: promote the charm revisions to the next channel
        - TEST_FAILED: manual intervention with SQA required


Question:
* Long-term, will there be different testplans for Canonical Kubernetes and Charmed Kubernetes or are we
  just replacing the product under test via addons?
* Why can I set the status of a testplaninstance when adding it? Isn't that the responsibility of the test scheduler?

TODOs:
* Support testing different architectures once SQA provides the feature
* Cleaning up outdated and aborted TPIs in a separate cronjob
